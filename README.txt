Template Activity Module for Moodle
==========================
This is a more modern, and at least for me, more useful template than the others available.
It contains admin and instance settings stubs, a renderer.php and a module.js . It also contains activity completion on grade, grade book logic, backup and restore and adgoc/scheduled tasks

To Use
===========
Replace all instances of ICECREAM with your uppercase module name eg WIDGET
Replace all instances of MOD_ICECREAM_ with your module name eg MOD_WIDGET_
Replace all instances of icecream with your module name eg widget
Replace all instances of 2015 Justin Hunt aka PoodLLGuy with something like "2015 Justin Hunt".
It is recommended to use a search and replace tool from a text editor or a command line script to do this.
Trying to do this manually is sure to lead to mistakes.
Make sure the plugin folder name, name of the langage file in lang/en, files in the backup/moodle2 folder, and files in the classes/task folder are also changed.

Copy the folder to your [Moodle Site Dir]/mod directory

Install as usual.

Enjoy.
